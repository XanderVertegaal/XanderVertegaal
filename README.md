Hi, my name is **Xander** and I am a 29-year-old full-stack web developer from the Netherlands who is passionate about web development. I love using **React** and **TypeScript** (with **Redux** for state management) to create good-looking and functional web applications.

Have a look at the pinned repos below to see how my journey into the world of web development is currently unfolding.
