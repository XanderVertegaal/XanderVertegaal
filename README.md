Hi, I am **Xander**, a 29-year-old full-stack web developer from the Netherlands. After working as a linguistic researcher for several years, I am now broadening my view and ready to take on a new job as a web developer. Although I have a background in both front-end and back-end technologies, I especially love using **React** and **TypeScript** (with **Redux** for state management) to create beautiful and functional web applications.

Check out some of the projects I did in the pinned repos below!
